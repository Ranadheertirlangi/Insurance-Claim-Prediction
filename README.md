# Insurance-Claim-Prediction

Developed a predictive model that determines whether a claimant will claim insurance based on features such as age, gender, seat belt usage, and reported loss. This helps insurance companies assess risk and streamline claim processing.

Key Features:

Input Features: Age, Gender, Seat Belt (Yes/No), Loss amount

Output: Binary prediction â€“ Claim or No Claim

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Modeling Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees (tested various models for best accuracy)

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized continuous features

Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy using metrics like Precision, Recall
